# Community Air Quality Map 

A map for communities to contribute their local knowledge of air polltion as part of Air Watch projects running across the UK.

Data is collected to show areas of good and bad air pollution so solutions to the pollution hotspots can be suggested by the people who know the area the best.

The map is powered by leaflet.js using a PHP backend and a mysql database. 

The Air Watch projects are currently in the process of being documented.

Please help us by contributing to the project by code review or improving documentation. Submit a pull request no matter how small!
